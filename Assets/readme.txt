Tetra Pack
----------

Thank you for purchasing Tetra Pack!

This package contains a complete tetris-like puzzlegame in minecraft block style.

The game consists of three scenes:
- startup		contains the initialization of the sound module, makes it persistent and loads the menu2
- menu2			contains the menu. Be warned: it may take a little time to load on slower computers due to many many gameobects
- game2			contains the game.

Each scene contains an empty game object with a script attached to. Use this as an entry point for further exploration.

If there are any problems with this package, feel free to ask for support in the comment section of the asset store.
